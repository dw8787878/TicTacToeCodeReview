# TicTacToeCodeReview

Tasks:
1. Define a structure on the code review.  What are the paramaters?  What are we looking for?  What is the checklist?
Ex. https://www.evoketechnologies.com/blog/code-review-checklist-perform-effective-code-reviews/
https://khmer.readthedocs.io/en/v2.0/dev/coding-guidelines-and-review.html#code-review

2. When reviewing code on a language you are unfamiliar with, we can focus on some of these things:
- Formatting, indentation
- Scope
- Loops
- Type operations

3. A good opportunity to learn more about the language.
